# Test-processor
This is a simple 8 bit Von neumann processor simulator written in C. I designed the ISA to be simple, not to be efficient. It is big-endian.
This project has no definitive purpose: I started it to practice writing CPU emulators before i move on to the 6502/z80 as well as as a way to get more experience with C.

This processor has 5 8-bit GPRs, noted (a,b,c,d and e) as well as an 8bit PC. These registers are given the IDs 00,01,02,03,04 and 05 respectively.
The processor has access to a 256 byte address space. Address 0xFF has a special significance however: jumping to this address will halt the processor and terminate the running program.
Note: all values are treated an unsigned 8bit (char) values.

There is currently no assembler for the processor. Programs have to be written in hex through a hex editor.
This binary file then needs to be named "testprogram.bin" and put in the same directory as the main code.

Register, opcode and address fields are all 8 bits wide.

The processor support 7 different instructions:  // replace $rd,$rs and $rt fields with the appropriate register IDs.
- a NOP instruction, with opcode 0x00. Does nothing and is one byte long (no additionnal parameters).
- an ADD instruction, with opcode 0x01. Syntax: opcode,$rs,$t,$rd.Is 4 bytes long.       //rd= rs+ rt
- a subtract instruction, with opcode 0x02. Syntax opcode,$rs,$t,$rd.Is 4 bytes long.      //rd = rs - rt
- A Jump instruction, with opcode 0x03. Syntax: opcode, target address. 2 bytes long.
- A conditionnal branch instruction, with opcode 0x04. It branches to the target address if rs<rt and falls through otherwise. Syntax: opcode,$rs,$rt,target. 4 bytes long.
- A register-memory Load instruction, with opcode 0x05. Takes the value present at the designated address and loads it into the designated register. Syntax: opcode,$rs,address. 3 bytes long.
- A register-memory Store instruction, with opcode 0x06. Takes the value from the designtaed register and loads it into memory at designated address. Syntax: opcode,$rs,address. 3 bytes long.



Instruction examples:
- Load a,0xFF would be 05 00 FF
- ADD c = a + b would be 01 00 01 02
- JMP 0xAE would be 03 AE
- Branch LT a,b,0xAA would be 04 00 01 AA

This is fairly Generic C89 and has no platform specific calls. It should be able to run in any OS.
